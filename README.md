# Quick Start

Before running the script make sure you have `go`, `pip` and `rust` installed.
```bash
# https://phoenixnap.com/kb/debian-install-go
sudo apt install python-pip # pip
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh # rust
```
To run the script use the following command:
```Bash
bash <(curl -L https://github.com/d3vyce/PenTools/releases/latest/download/pentools.sh)
```
This script has been tested on debian distribution, but it should also work with Ubuntu.
I'm working on a compatibility with CentOS and other distribution.
