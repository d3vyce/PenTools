# Quick Start

Before running the script make sure you have `go` and `pip` installed.

```Bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3vyce/PenTools/dev/pentools.sh)
```

This script has been tested on debian distribution, but it should also work with Ubuntu.
I'm working on a compatibility with CentOS and other distribution.
