# Quick Start

Before running the script make sure you have `go` and `pip` installed.
```bash
sudo apt install gccgo-go
sudo apt install python-pip
```
To run the script use the following command:
```Bash
bash <(curl -s https://github.com/d3vyce/PenTools/releases/latest/download/pentools.sh)
```
This script has been tested on debian distribution, but it should also work with Ubuntu.
I'm working on a compatibility with CentOS and other distribution.
