# Quick Start

Before running the script make sure you have `go` and `pip` installed.

```Bash
curl -L https://github.com/d3vyce/pentools/releases/latest/download/pentools.sh | sh
```

This script has been tested on debian distribution, but it should also work with Ubuntu.
I'm working on a compatibility with CentOS and other distribution.
